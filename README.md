# Web Development Bootcamp Exercises

This repository contains my personal exercises and projects from the Web Development Bootcamp I am currently enrolled in. It serves as a record of my learning journey, showcasing the progression of my web development skills over time.

The repository will already have many of these exercises done from the first commit, as I did a substantial part of the Bootcamp while saving everything locally.

## About the Bootcamp

The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp from 'The App Brewery' is an intensive course designed to take students from beginners to job-ready web developers. Covering a wide range of topics from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to advanced frameworks and back-end technologies, the bootcamp is structured to provide a comprehensive foundation in web development.

Several Capstone Projects in my GitHub repository, initially intended as short to mid-size bootcamp assignments, have evolved into more comprehensive projects aimed at meeting industry standards.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into Front-end and Back-end exercises from many different technologies. Each directory inside them represents a specific section or project from the course, containing the exercises and my solutions.

Some examples of these sections are:

- `HTML and CSS`: Exercises related to basic web page structure and styling.
- `JavaScript Basics`: Fundamental concepts of JavaScript programming.
- `Advanced JavaScript`: Complex topics such as asynchronous programming and ES6 features.
- `Front-End Frameworks`: Projects and exercises using frameworks like React.
- `Back-End Development`: Node.js, Express, and database integration exercises.
- `Full-Stack Projects`: Comprehensive projects that integrate both front-end and back-end technologies.
- 'Extra Modules': Usage of trending tech like Blockchain / Web3

## Reflections

This course was an absolute blast and taught me way more than I could've imagined. I've always been drawn to Web Development because you can get really creative with it, but this course took my skills and excitement to another level. Angela Yu is just awesome â€“ she made learning fun and kept things light, all while dishing out super useful tips on coding the right way and using the latest and greatest tech in the biz.
